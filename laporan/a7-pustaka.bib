	abstract = {In this modern era, Indonesian society widely utilizes social media, particularly Twitter, as a means to express their opinions. Every day, various opinions of Indonesian citizens are disseminated on this platform, including their views on prospective presidential candidates for the year 2024. Analyzing public opinions regarding prospective presidential candidates in 2024 is crucial to understanding the sentiment of the people toward these candidates. Such sentiment analysis can be conducted using deep learning techniques such as IndoBERT to acquire knowledge regarding the classification of sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. IndoBERT is employed to generate vector representations that encapsulate the meaning of tokens, words, phrases, or texts. These representation vectors can then be input into a classification model to perform sentiment analysis. The sentiment classification model undergoes testing with a diverse set of tweets in the test dataset, which represent a wide range of public opinions. The evaluation results indicate an overall accuracy rate of 80\%, with precision rates of 62\% for negative sentiment, 81\% for neutral sentiment, and 85\% for positive sentiment. Additionally, the recall rates for each sentiment are 64\% for negative, 81\% for neutral, and 84\% for positive, with corresponding F1-scores of 63\%, 81\%, and 85\%, respectively.},

They can be also used by business entities to find out public opinion about their product or the performance of their business products. It will be very difficult to process the review data manually and it will take a long time. Therefore, sentiment analysis automation can be used to get polarity information from existing reviews. In this study, IndoBERT with Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) was used to automate sentiment analysis of Indonesian reviews. The data used was a sentiment analysis dataset obtained from IndoNLU with sentiment consisting of negative sentiment, neutral sentiment, and positive sentiment. The results of the test showed that IndoBERT with the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) had better results than the IndoBERT base. IndoBERT with Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) obtained 95.16\% accuracy, 94.05\% precision, 92.74\% recall and 93.27\% f1 score.},

This work investigates a novel study on the effectiveness and efficiency of three IndoBERT-based models for solving the ABSA task in Indonesian language. IndoBERT is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, i.e., bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), that was pre-trained on Indonesian language. Our first model utilizes IndoBERT in a feature-based mode, paired with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and machine learning models, for single-sentence classification. Next, our second model is obtained by fine- tuning the IndoBERT model for a typical single-sentence classification to build an end-to-end model. At last, our third model also adopts a fine-tuning approach to use IndoBERT, but for sentence-pair classification by utilizing auxiliary sentences. Our results demonstrate that the third model, the fine- tuned IndoBERT for sentence-pair classification, gains the highest effectiveness. It demonstrates significant improvement over deep learning baselines (Word2Vec-CNN-XGBoost) by 23.6\% and transformer-based baselines (mBERT-aux-NLIB) by 2.2\% in terms of F-1 score. When considering both effectiveness and efficiency, the results show that the best- performing model is our second model, the fine-tuned IndoBERT for single- sentence classification.},

	abstract = {The perceptions and expressions shared by the public on social media play a crucial role in shaping the reputation of government institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance MOF (Kemenkeu) in Indonesia which also has faced increased scrutiny, particularly on Twitter. This study analyzes public sentiment towards the Indonesian Ministry of Finance (MoF) through Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on Twitter data. Using a dataset of 10,099 tweets from January to July 2024, this study combines IndoBERT for sentiment classification and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. Here, LDA was tested across four scenarios that considered various combinations of stopwords removal and stemming techniques, resulting in coherence scores of 0.314256, 0.369636, 0.350285, and 0.541752. The most optimal results were achieved in the scenario of stopwords removal without stemming (with 0.314256 coherence score). The main results show: 1) Identification of four main topics related to MoF: Economy, Budget, Employees, and Tax; 2) The dominance of negative sentiment (6,837 tweets) compared to positive sentiment (198 tweets) across all topics; 3) The effectiveness of IndoBERT in handling the complexity of the Indonesian language, especially in interpreting context and language nuances; 4) The importance of proper preprocessing, with a scenario of removing stopwords without stemming resulting in the most relevant topics. This study provides valuable insights for MoF to understand public perception and identify areas that require special attention in public communication and policy.},

Traditional Sentiment Analysis methods can only analyze sentences as a whole, prompting this research to develop an Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) approach, which includes aspect extraction and sentiment classification. However, ABSA has inconsistencies in aspect detection and sentiment classification. To address this, we propose the BERT method using the pre-trained Indo-Bert model, currently the best NLP model for the Indonesian language. This study also fine-tunes hyperparameters to optimize results. The dataset comprises 10,000 student reviews obtained from online questionnaires. Experimental results show that the aspect extraction model has an accuracy of 0.890 and an F1-Score of 0.897, while the sentiment classification model has an accuracy of 0.879 and an F1-Score of 0.882. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying aspects and sentiments in student reviews and provide a comparison between the four algorithms.},

	abstract = {The curriculum has changed once again with the introduction of the Merdeka Curriculum to address learning loss in the education sector. Its implementation has elicited various responses, such as support for granting teachers the freedom to innovate, focusing on essential materials, offering diverse learning methods, and fostering student creativity. However, criticism has also arisen, including issues related to teachers’ lack of understanding, parents' concerns, and the increased workload on students due to numerous projects. To improve educational policies, an in-depth analysis of these responses is essential. This study aims to analyze public sentiment toward the Merdeka Curriculum by applying Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using data from Twitter. The research focuses on four main aspects: Teaching Modules (MA), Education Reports (RP), the Merdeka Teaching Platform (PMM), and the Strengthening of the Pancasila Student Profile Projects (P5). Data were collected using specific and relevant keywords for each aspect, followed by preprocessing, labeling, and filtering based on sentiment and aspect. The final dataset comprised 2,359 valid tweets. The ABSA model was developed using IndoBERT with fine-tuning, then tested and evaluated. The results showed that the aspect classification model achieved an accuracy of 97\%, F1 score of 97\%, recall of 97\%, and precision of 97\%. Meanwhile, the sentiment classification model achieved an accuracy of 85\%, F1 score of 85\%, recall of 85\%, and precision of 85\%. This ABSA model is expected to assist in monitoring public responses and provide valuable insights for policy development, particularly within the context of the Merdeka Curriculum.},

	abstract = {Background: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is essential in extracting meaningful insights from user-generated content (UGC) in various domains. In tourism, UGC such as Google Reviews offers essential feedback, but the challenges associated with processing in Indonesian language, including the unique linguistic characteristics, pose difficulties for automatic sentiment, and aspect detection. Recent advancements in transformer-based models, such as BERT, have shown great potential in addressing these challenges by providing context-aware embeddings. Objective: This research aimed to fine-tune IndoBERT, a pre-trained Indonesian language model, to perform information extraction and key aspect detection from tourism-related UGC. The objective was to identify critical aspects of tourism reviews and classify their sentiments. Methods: A dataset of 20,000 Google Reviews, focusing on 20 tourism destinations in DI Yogyakarta and Jawa Tengah, was collected and preprocessed. Multiple fine-tuning experiments were conducted, using a layer-freezing method by adjusting only the top layers of IndoBERT, while freezing others to determine the optimal configuration. The model's performance was evaluated based on validation loss, precision, recall, and F1-score in aspect detection and overall sentiment classification accuracy. Results: The best-performing configuration involved freezing the last six layers and fine-tuning the top six layers of IndoBERT, yielding a validation loss of 0.324. The model achieved precision scores between 0.85 and 0.89 in aspect detection and an overall sentiment classification accuracy of 0.84. Error analysis revealed challenges in distinguishing neutral and negative sentiments and in handling reviews with multiple aspects or mixed sentiments. Conclusion: The fine-tuned IndoBERT model effectively extracted key tourism aspects and classified sentiments from Indonesian UGC. While the model performed well in detecting strong sentiments, improvements are needed to handle neutral and mixed sentiments better. Future work will explore sentiment intensity analysis and aspect segmentation methods to enhance the model's performance.},

	abstract = {Online reviews significantly shape public perception and play a crucial role in customer decision-making within the hospitality sector. This research aims to conduct aspect-based sentiment analysis on Indonesian five-star hotel reviews using a fine-tuned IndoBERT model. Unlike prior studies that mainly applied IndoBERT to single hotels or small-scale datasets, this study fills that gap by examining 2,499 reviews collected from five luxury hotels in Jakarta. The analysis focuses on five essential service aspects: cleanliness, service quality, room comfort, food \& beverages, and core facilities. The IndoBERT-base model was finetuned with annotated aspect-sentiment data and assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Experimental results show that the model reached 95.28\% accuracy with a macro F1-score of 82.44\%. Positive sentiment dominated the reviews (81.4\%), while neutral and negative sentiments represented 16.9\% and 1.7\%, respectively. Service, along with food \& beverages, received the highest praise, whereas cleanliness and core facilities were more often evaluated neutrally. Aspect and sentiment annotations were carried out semiautomatically using large language models (LLMs) and later validated by human annotators to ensure reliability. These findings highlight IndoBERT’s strong capability in aspect-based sentiment classification for Indonesian hotel reviews and provide actionable insights for hotel managers to enhance service quality. Moreover, this study demonstrates both the academic and practical significance of applying fine-tuned Transformer models to real-world customer experience analysis.},

	abstract = {Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a sentiment analysis technique that not only identifies overall sentiment, but also reveals opinions on specific aspects of an entity. To facilitate computer processing, a numerical representation of words into vectors (word embedding) is used, where each word or phrase is mapped into a vector of dimension N. Although static embedding such as Word2Vec or GloVe has been widely used, these approaches have limitations in capturing the dynamic context essential for deep sentiment analysis. This research develops and tests several deep learning algorithms, namely CNN, Bi-LSTM, CNN+BiLSTM, and CNN+BiLSTM+Attention Mechanism, which initially use static embedding and then modified by integrating BERT as contextual embedding. The results show that the use of BERT improves sentiment prediction accuracy by 15\% and aspect prediction accuracy by 11\% compared to models with static embedding. In particular, the combination of BERT+CNN obtained the best accuracy, which was 94\% for aspect prediction and the combination of BERT+CNN+BiLSTM+Attention Mechanism 87\% for sentiment prediction. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of BERT integration in improving ABSA performance, which can be applied in social media opinion analysis and sentiment-based recommendation systems.},

The results of the classification of multi-aspect sentiment analysis showed that the highest accuracy was achieved by the service aspect at 92\%, the user satisfaction aspect was 87\%, and the lowest accuracy was achieved by the system aspect at 75\%. Based on the sentiment analysis results, companies can improve aspects of the Bibit application system and services to provide better services \& functionality.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the learning process requires a platform for students to express feedback and suggestions openly through online reviews. Sentiment analysis is often used to analyze review texts but typically captures only overall sentiment without identifying specific aspects. This study develops an aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) model using IndoBERT, a pre-trained model tailored for the Indonesian language. The research uses 10,000 student reviews from Indonesian universities, processed through data labeling, text preprocessing, and splitting, followed by model training and performance evaluation. The model demonstrated superior performance with an aspect extraction accuracy of 0.973, an F1-score of 0.952, a sentiment classification accuracy of 0.979, and an F1-score of 0.974. Experimental results indicate that the proposed ABSA model surpasses previous state-of-the-art models in analyzing sentiment related to specific aspects of educational evaluation. By leveraging IndoBERT, the model effectively handles linguistic complexities and provides detailed insights into student experiences. These findings highlight the potential of the ABSA model in enhancing learning evaluations by offering precise, aspectfocused feedback, contributing to strategies for improving the quality of higher education.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the performance of a sentiment classification model leveraging IndoBERT to analyze Indonesian hotel review data. Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting actionable insights from customer reviews, yet challenges such as linguistic diversity and imbalanced datasets complicate accurate classification. The dataset comprises 90\% Positive, 5\% Neutral, and 5\% Negative sentiments, reflecting significant class imbalance. A fine-tuned IndoBERT model was trained over three epochs, with performance assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC and Precision-Recall curves. The results indicate high global accuracy (92.52\%) and robust performance for the Positive class (F1-score: 96.09\%, AUC: 0.90). However, significant limitations were observed for minority classes, with the Neutral class achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.00, and the Negative class obtaining a low F1-score of 28.57\%. These findings underscore the influence of dataset imbalance, where the dominance of the Positive class skews model predictions. Future research should explore techniques such as oversampling SMOTE, reweighting loss functions, or hybrid architectures to mitigate imbalance and improve performance across all sentiment categories. This research contributes to advancing sentiment classification methodologies for Indonesian text, offering practical implications for enhancing customer feedback analysis in the hospitality industry.},

A dataset of 32,000 reviews was utilized for this study. The research methodology followed the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. A crucial step in the modeling phase was category mapping, which involved identifying critical aspects of OTT services from the dataset. Word clouds were employed to visualize the most frequent terms associated with each aspect. Result: The fine-tuned IndoBERT model achieved impressive performance, with an accuracy of 95\%, precision of 94\%, recall of 94\%, and an F1 score of 94\%. This indicates the model’s effectiveness in classifying sentiment towards specific aspects of OTT services. The final stage of the CRISP-DM deployment process involved creating interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize the sentiment analysis results. Conclusion: This research successfully employed a fine-tuned IndoBERT model and aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques to analyze user sentiment toward Indonesian video streaming application services on the Google Play Store. The model deployment through interactive dashboards facilitated the visualization and interpretation of sentiment analysis results. By leveraging these insights, OTT service providers can make datadriven decisions to improve user satisfaction, optimize their services, and gain a competitive edge in the market.},

	abstract = {Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a sentiment analysis technique that not only identifies overall sentiment, but also reveals opinions on specific aspects of an entity. To facilitate computer processing, a numerical representation of words into vectors (word embedding) is used, where each word or phrase is mapped into a vector of dimension N. Although static embedding such as Word2Vec or GloVe has been widely used, these approaches have limitations in capturing the dynamic context essential for deep sentiment analysis. This research develops and tests several deep learning algorithms, namely CNN, Bi-LSTM, CNN+BiLSTM, and CNN+BiLSTM+Attention Mechanism, which initially use static embedding and then modified by integrating BERT as contextual embedding. The results show that the use of BERT improves sentiment prediction accuracy by 15\% and aspect prediction accuracy by 11\% compared to models with static embedding. In particular, the combination of BERT+CNN obtained the best accuracy, which was 94\% for aspect prediction and the combination of BERT+CNN+BiLSTM+Attention Mechanism 87\% for sentiment prediction. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of BERT integration in improving ABSA performance, which can be applied in social media opinion analysis and sentiment-based recommendation systems.},
